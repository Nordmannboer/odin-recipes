        <p>This pizza is one of my favorite dishes! It's really simple to make and won't take long, but it's still delicious!</p>
        Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Pineapple slices</li>
            <li>Pepperoni</li>
            <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour, yeast, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl, until it becomes a dough</li>
            <li>If the dough is sticky, add some more flour and mix it until it has a nice texture</li>
            <li>Let the dough grow in the bowl under a sheet of plastic for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Turn on your oven to 225 degrees Celsius, while shaping the dough into a pizza shape</li>
            <li>Smear the tomato sauce across the pizza dough, and afterwards spread the pepperoni slices and pineapple evenly across the surface</li>
            <li>Finally pour the cheese all over the pizza, and put the pizza into the heated oven for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Take the pizza out of the oven, and let it cool down for 5 minutes and voila, you're in for a treat</li>
        </ol>
